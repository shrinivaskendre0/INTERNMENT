# INTERNMENT
 The INTERNMENT (College Campus Placement Management System) is an online platform designed to streamline the campus placement process for both students and college Training and Placement Officers (TPOs). It facilitates job searching, application, and placement tracking. INTERNMENT addresses this need by providing a user-friendly interface where students can create accounts, explore job opportunities, build resumes, and apply for positions. Simultaneously, TPOs can effortlessly post job listings, monitor the placement process, and manage candidate shortlisting.
